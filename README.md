### Asteroids Game 
This project was created for [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev). It was designed to use [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org), a Python library for game development. The objective was to create a simple game where the player controls a ship that shoots to destroy asteroids. When hit, smaller asteroids are destroyed, while larger ones split into two smaller asteroids.
